# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- Integrate the pre-trained Vision Transformer model in WebAssembly (WASM) for layer separation in image processing.

## Relevant Context
- The Vision Transformer model is a state-of-the-art transformer architecture designed for image analysis.
- Using a pre-trained model in WASM ensures efficient CPU usage and performance on the client side.

## Next Steps
1. Convert to Vite/React app
2. Improve UX 100100times!

## Completed Steps
- [x] Converted `imageUpload.js` to `imageUpload.tsx`
- [x] Converted `imagePreprocessing.js` to `imagePreprocessing.tsx`
- [x] Converted `visualizationTools.js` to `visualizationTools.tsx`
- [x] Updated `App.tsx` to import and use the new TypeScript components
